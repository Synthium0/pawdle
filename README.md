# Pawdle

It's [hello wordl](hellowordl.net) but play to earn!


## Introduction

Pawdle is a fork of hello wordl, which is a clone of Wordle.

You get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is _elsewhere_ in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.

## For developers

You're very welcome to create your own Wordle offshoot/remix based on _pawdle_. To get started, you can [fork the code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on GitHub.

To run the code locally, first install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm). Then, in this directory, open a terminal and run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. _pawdle_ will be running at http://localhost:3000/. Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected there. Have fun!

Finally, `npm run deploy` will deploy your code to the `gh-pages` branch of your fork, so that everyone can play your version at https://yourname.github.io/pawdle (or the name of your fork if you renamed it).
